# Detox TDD demo

Detox is a gray box end-to-end testing and automation library for mobile apps.

This repository is based on [React Native Starter App](https://github.com/mcnamee/react-native-starter-app/), and was created as a compliment to the article [Why I use Detox: An E2E Mobile Testing Use Case](https://goo.gl/5uhB3e).

The commits found here follow a very simplistic example of a TDD workflow, and are mainly meant to demo some of Detox' features.
